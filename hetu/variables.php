In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable:
Rules for PHP variables:

        A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
        A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
        A variable name cannot start with a number
        A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
        Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)
